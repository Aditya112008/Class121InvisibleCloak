Invisible Cloak : 
We will be using the camera (cv2) to access the camera 
We will create a magical experience using the image processing technique called color-detection and segmentation
These are the steps we need to follow :

1. Capture and store the background frame (This will be done for some seconds )
2. Detect the red colored cloak using color detection and segmentation algorithm 
3. Segement out the red colored cloak by generating a mask
4. Generate the final output to create a magical effect 

HUE : this channel encodes color information 
HUE can be thought if as an angle where 
0   degree -> red 
120 degree -> green 
240 degree -> blue 

SATURATION : this channel encodes the intensity / purity of the color
E.g. Pink is less saturated than red 

VALUE : this channel encodes the brightness of the color 
e.g. shading of an image appears in this channel
